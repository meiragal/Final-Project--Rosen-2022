# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Plan: 

Our plan is to create a website where patients can enter their immunization records and be able to see which vaccines they need to get and when they need to get them (date). 

The website will also provide a brief description of each vaccine and further information about where to get it/how. 

Description: 
For patients 18+ 

Our pages on the vaccine forecasting website will include: 
An information page on specific vaccines (i.e. facts, data, statistics) 
A page where you can enter your immunization records and it will return the information of where and when to get the next vaccination

What will happen:
Patient will have to enter immunization information
The computer  will convert immunization pdf to csv format 
Then, the computer will return the vaccines that the patients are lacking and provide directions to the nearest pharmacy
